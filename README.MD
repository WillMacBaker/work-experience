## PROJECT TITLE

## DESCRIPTION
This website is a basic HTML, CSS and JS site, designed to illustrate the basics of front-end web software work! Welcome to your work experience day!

## TECHNOLOGIES
We're going to be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Nothing too fancy or elaborate in this repository, just a quick speedrun tour of the basics to get warmed up.


## LICENCE
If you ever work on any fancy project work, understanding and declaring a license is important as it defines ownership, and what others can do with the work. A lot of open-source projects work on a form of attribution, whereby anyone can modify and adjust code, as long as authors are credited for their work! You won't need to worry about this today, but it's good to be aware of it!
