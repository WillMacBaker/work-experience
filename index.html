    <h1>Welcome to the Web Development Intro!</h1>
    <p>I've set this up so that you can get to grips with the absolute basics! What this exercise will do is get you adjusting things, and adding other elements.</p>
    <p>
        I've put together this basic repository so that you can check through a few basic exercises; depending on what experience you already have, we can skip over certain items, or we can go
        through each page thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>At any time, please feel free to ask me questions, and I'll do my best to help out during the code session!</p>
    
    <!-- Add a heading with an id attribute for styling -->
    <h2 id="header-task">Your tasks for this session, are broken down into the following sections.</h2>

        <section id="intro-section">
            <h3 class="section-header" id="header-3">Section 1: Understanding basic HTML elements</h3>
            <li>Check over the code for this page, and get a basic understanding of how things are shown. Look up the names of the tags!</li>
            <li>Try adding a few new basic elements to this page. Try using some 'p' tags, but get creative!</li>
            <li>Once you've figured out how to add some elements, try to write a short section telling me about what you'd like to make. A website? A game? Some other software item?</li>
        </section>
        <!-- Add a new section with a link -->
        <section id="intro-section">
            <h3 class="section-header" id="header-3">Section 2: Styling and Basic CSS</h3>
            <li>You'll notice the pages...look a little bare. This is why we need CSS! If you're checking out these files in VSCode, then check out the index.css file to the left, and read through the comments I've placed there.</li>
            <li>If you're reading this in the vscode window, you should see that the elements on this page have something called 'classes' and 'id's on them. Have a look through, and see which ones are in the index.css file!</li>
        </section>

        <!-- Add a new section with a form -->
        <section id="intro-section">
            <h3 class="section-header" id="header-3">Section 3: Forms and Basic Interactivity</h3>
            <p>So you've covered the basics, but what about making our site *interactive*? Here, we'll start looking at our JS </p>
            <form>
                <label for="name">What's your name?</label>
                <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br><br>
                <label for="email">What's your email address?</label>
                <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>
                <input type="submit" value="Submit">
            </form>
