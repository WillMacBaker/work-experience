    <h1>Welcome to the Web Development Intro!</h1>
    <p>I've set this up so that you can get to grips with the absolute basics! What this exercise will do is get you adjusting things, and adding other elements.</p>
    <p>
        I've put together this basic repository so that you can check through a few basic exercises; depending on what experience you already have, we can skip over certain items, or we can go
        through each page thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>At any time, please feel free to ask me questions, and I'll do my best to help out during the code session!</p>
