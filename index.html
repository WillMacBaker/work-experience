    <h1>Welcome to the Test Playground!</h1>
    <p>The above is made by using a 'h1' element, </p>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>This is a basic 'p' element and is used to type out lines of text </p>

        <!-- Section 1: Understanding basic HTML elements, and how they make things show up on a page. -->
            <h3 class="section-1"> </h3>
            <li>Check over the code for this page, and get a basic understanding of how things are shown. Look up the names of the tags!</li>
            <li>Try adding a few new basic elements to this page. Try using some 'p' tags, but get creative!</li>
            <li>Once you've figured out how to add some elements, try to write a short section telling me about what you'd like to make. A website? A game? Some other software item?</li>

            <li>You'll notice this page...looks a little bare. This is why we need *css*! Check out the index.css file to the left, and read through the comments I've placed there.</li>
            <li>If you're reading this in the vscode window, you should see that the elements on this page have something called 'classes' and 'id's on them. Have a look through, and see which ones are in the index.css file!</li>
            <!-- TODO FOR WILL, ADD ONE CLASS ENTRY TO STYLE ONE THING, BUT COMMENTED OUT. IN THE CSS CODE, ASK THEM TO UNCOMMENT SECTION, AND SAVE. -->
