<p>Want some ideas? Check out w3schools for a starter on adding some basic items! Try to add at least three or four elements, as simple or complex as you want, before moving on.</p>

<li>Check over the code for this page, and get a basic understanding of how things are shown. Look up the names of the tags!</li>
<li>Try adding a few new basic elements to this page. Try using some 'p' tags, but get creative!</li>
<li>Once you've figured out how to add some elements, try to write a short section telling me about what you'd like to make. A website? A game? Some other software item?</li>
