        <h2>Page 2: Making pages look a bit more stylish with CSS.</h2>
        <li>You'll notice the pages...look a little bare. This is why we need CSS! If you're checking out these files in VSCode, then check out the index.css file to the left, and read through the comments I've placed there.</li>
        <li>If you're reading this in the vscode window, you should see that the elements on this page have something called 'classes' and 'id's on them. Have a look through, and see which ones are in the index.css file!</li>
