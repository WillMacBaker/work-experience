<h2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You've had a - hopefully - interesting poke of this site!</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>So you've finally gotten past the basics! If you've been keeping an eye on the VSCode terminal, you'll have noticed that every time you save to a file, it adds to the list of changes!</p>
<p>This will be a bit more hands-on with me sitting with you, just in case you've not done any sort of commit work whatsoever, but in short...:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We'll cover Git, and what it does, at a very basic, functional 'what you need to know' level!</li>
    <li>What GitHub is, how people use it, and how you can see changes people make, and contribute to code.</li>
    <li>Understanding the basics of checking out a branch, and pushing changes to it. We'll be able to see it from another device!</li>
    <li>Learning how to 'merge' branches, so that a bunch of changes made in one 'test' branch can be, well, merged into the parent 'main' branch.</li>
    <li>After this, I can show you the basics of what we do in our day-to-day work, as part of some shadowing sessions later on!</li>
</ul>
